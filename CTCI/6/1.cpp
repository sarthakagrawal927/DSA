19 pills wt = 1g, 1 pill wt = 1.1g
Take 1 pill out of 1st bottle, 2 out of 2nd , i out of ith bottle.

total would be 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55 pills, ideally weight should be 55g but more the deviation the higher numbered bottle has heavypills

2) p < 3C1 * p**2 * (1-p) + p**3

3) 7-8-8-8-8-8-8-7
    So it won't be possible as 1 space will always be left  in both ends.

4) 1 - 1/(2**(n-1))

5) fill 5 pour in 3, clear 3, pour 5 -> 3, now 3 has 2l, refil 5 , fill 3 with 5 now 5 is left w 4.

6) Answer would be number of people with blue eyes. as n > 0, on 1st day blue eyed guy seeing no one
 else with blue will leave, if 2, on first day they will observe everyone , on realizing left in case of n=1, they both will
 leave together.

7) Finding number of boys avg b4 girl is born will come out to be sigma(i/2**i) -> infinity. Resulting in 1. Hence 1:1

8)

9) Its factors thing, numbers having odd number of factors will remain open
   As the factors exists in pair so the only number having odd number of factors
   would be perfect squares.

10) using binary numbers, 1st strip will have every 2nd strip, 2nd will have every 4th soda similary ith will have every 2**ith bottle
    The positive tested would give us a binary number.
