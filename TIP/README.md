# TIP

## 1 - Intro

About instructors and intro.

## 2 - Interview Process

If you get tasks (of project) : just do them.
If given coding task : Use external Resources, write quality code.

There there can be a phone screen interview : Be well prepared for it. They want to make sure they you are not a jerk or test your ability. Usually fixed questions and same as onsite interview. Lookup domain based questions before. Be confident. Practice mock interviews. Everything will be recorded. Big companies will select if you pass the bar, small will select you if you are among the best choices.

## 3 -

Onsite interviews can be multiple (4-6). Jr Developer are asked coding questions like puzzles etc. 10-15mins for intro but that depends on the interviewer. First impressions are extremely important. Follow ups and alternative solutions are extremely important , knowing deeply about the projects you have done is also very important.

## 4 -

They won't give any feedback, HR issue. Once rejected, you are rejected. Company is not responsible for explaining why you did not get selected. Axis based on selection : Coding, DSA, Design, Communication (being able to explain technical things), efficiency (speed matters).

## 5 -

Question would be dependent on the interviewer. FB won't ask DP. Some recalliberated questions are asked everytime. Big companies take you for your ability to learn (whether they are worth investing in, not a jerk/arrogant, and you are smart, your behavior matters alot), startups need you to have experience with particulat tech stack. Just do what they say instead of being an arrogant jerk.

## 6 - Getting Interviews

Just GET A REFERRAL (they get money too). Companies put a lot of value to referrals. Applying through front door is really hard. You can text recruiters in LinkedIn, always send cover letter with your Resume. Getting first gig is the hardest after that you just snowball. Do projects if you do not have work experience. Projects that you can talk about really well. Course projects do not show your competency. Building some project from scratch is extremely important. Open source is not that too important.

## 7 - Applying

Interview Experiencing is really important. More offers would be more leverage , more money. 98% time do leetcode, handwrite codes. Do not a lot talk about things irrevelant to company. Junior developers are judged by your ability to learn is most important at large tech companies. Should have foundation for being a senior engineer.
