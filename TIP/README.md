# TIP

## 1 - Intro

About instructors and intro.

## 2 - Interview Process

If you get tasks (of project) : just do them.
If given coding task : Use external Resources, write quality code.

There there can be a phone screen interview : Be well prepared for it. They want to make sure they you are not a jerk or test your ability. Usually fixed questions and same as onsite interview. Lookup domain based questions before. Be confident. Practice mock interviews. Everything will be recorded. Big companies will select if you pass the bar, small will select you if you are among the best choices.

## 3 -

Onsite interviews can be multiple (4-6). Jr Developer are asked coding questions like puzzles etc. 10-15mins for intro but that depends on the interviewer. First impressions are extremely important. Follow ups and alternative solutions are extremely important , knowing deeply about the projects you have done is also very important.

## 4 -

They won't give any feedback, HR issue. Once rejected, you are rejected. Company is not responsible for explaining why you did not get selected. Axis based on selection : Coding, DSA, Design, Communication (being able to explain technical things), efficiency (speed matters).

## 5 -

Question would be dependent on the interviewer. FB won't ask DP. Some recalliberated questions are asked everytime. Big companies take you for your ability to learn (whether they are worth investing in, not a jerk/arrogant, and you are smart, your behavior matters alot), startups need you to have experience with particulat tech stack. Just do what they say instead of being an arrogant jerk.

## 6 - Getting Interviews

Just GET A REFERRAL (they get money too). Companies put a lot of value to referrals. Applying through front door is really hard. You can text recruiters in LinkedIn, always send cover letter with your Resume. Getting first gig is the hardest after that you just snowball. Do projects if you do not have work experience. Projects that you can talk about really well. Course projects do not show your competency. Building some project from scratch is extremely important. Open source is not that too important.

## 7 - Applying

Interview Experiencing is really important. More offers would be more leverage , more money. 98% time do leetcode, handwrite codes. Do not a lot talk about things irrevelant to company. Junior developers are judged by your ability to learn is most important at large tech companies. Should have foundation for being a senior engineer.

## 8 - The Axioms : Coding

Make sure you have decided your skill (front-end, backend etc.) Choose one be really good at it but also showcase other skills too. The coding portion of the interview : can you write production based code and is structural, OOP is OP. Make clear functions in classes , with predecided variables. For recursive questions always use helper functions that is private. Make it real easy to understand. Recursion is not recommended, convert it using stack and while loop. Languages like c,c++ not recommended as they will take you much more time to code in. Be willing to write real code.

## 9 - Data Structures

Coming up with a nice data structure is the key. Key data structures : array, sets, hashmaps, dictionaries, queues, stacks, graphs, trees, tries. Less likely to ask red-black, priority queue,heaps etc. Composing the common data structures is important. If you think some obsecure data structure and algorithms are needed for question, you are prolly wrong. Most candidates will solve the problem, you need to be efficient and fast. More exposure the better. The question bank is limited.

## 10 - Design Axiom

Able to come up with analysis and offer alternatives. Understand tradeoff between space and time. Design data structures is important. Get approval from interviewer with various designs by giving him options, be confident.

## 11 - Comprehension & Communication

Your ability to communicate can be a bottleneck, so make sure your communication is great and you should be clearly explain the technical details of your code and project. They only really care about what did you do. Assume they know nothing. There is no pressure on you to talk while you are desiging something or coding. Every problem is solvable. Not able to solve ? ask for a hint by telling them about your thought process. Be willing to take feedback. Don't talk too long, stick to crucial details.

## 12 - Efficiancy

Blow through easy questions as soon as possible. Don't take bathroom breaks, use maximum time to impress. Projects are extremely important. Interviewers have a credibility to maintain so they are just trying to get the best hire.

## 13 - Top Tips

Time Management is extremely important. Try to get the first and end note right. Ask good questions from the interviewer at the end. Talk about some new technology that everyone is interested in talking about. Ask something that will end good. Be collaborative and confident. Do not make them go through output processing. Have a good introduction and they do not have time to read your resumes. Get a good marker for onsite interviews (also start at top left corner), another copy of latest resume.

## 14 - Preventing 10 mistakes

1. Write code too.

2. Rehearse for behavioural questions. Demonstrating leadership , solving a challenging problem etc.

3. Doing mock interviews.

4. Do not try to memorise solutions.

5. Think out loud, share tradeoffs, analysis.

6. Do not rush to the coding part. Consider the edge cases.

7. Write good code, no sloppiness.

8. Revise your code.

9. Fix your code at once, instead of multiple one.

10. Never Give up. If you are failing, other people are failing too.
