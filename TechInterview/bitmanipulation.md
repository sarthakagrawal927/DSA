# Bit Manipulation

## And

## OR

## XOR

Different Value -> 1, Same -> 0
Given an array where every element is repeated twice but one. Find that number:
Just XOR every num, as 2 same numbers will toggle each back to 0, so only non repeating will exist.

## Rshift

-> , /2 , efficient way to divide by 2

## Lshift

<- , *2 ,  efficient way to multiply by 2.

It can be thought of efficient as high level code when converted to machine level code , shift operations are cheaper. But in reality the compilers have optimized enough to not let it effect.
