4) Weakness - I have an urge to complete things

8) During my work as system admin , we were a team of 7 and work was piling onto us due to these deadlines from student council and this 1 guy was not doing any work. He was not participating in group conversations, I then confronted him about why was he not contributing anything. He didn't feel like it was important to work, then I calmly made him realize that he has taken a responsibility and he should help out so he agreed to work on 1 portal solely. It was a win but still we were not exactly working in a team. So I came up with an idea to play games in weeked to promote team bonding and after 2 weeks he had done his solo portal and was ready to join us in the mammoth project.
